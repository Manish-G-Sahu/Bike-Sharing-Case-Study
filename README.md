# Bike-Sharing-Case-Study

## Problem Statement:
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue declines during the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover and thrive in the post-lockdown market, the company aims to understand the key factors influencing daily bike demand. This analysis will help predict demand more effectively, enabling BoomBikes to optimize operations, meet customer needs, and gain a competitive edge.

## Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
